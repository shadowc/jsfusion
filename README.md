JsFusion is a JavaScript Framework designed to work together with technologies
such as [@hotwired/turbo](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo) to seamlessly
apply client functionality to HTML templates dynamically. It is greatly
inspired on [Stimulus](https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus) (improving upon
it) and somewhat inspired in ReactJS and VueJS (borrowed some syntax
strategies and features).
